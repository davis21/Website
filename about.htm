            For God knows that when you eat of every tree of the third river is
            Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Tigris,
            which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the ground
            because of you; in toil you shall eat bread until you return to the
            ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, I have
            given every green plant for food. And it was a delight to the voice
            of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of life also in the midst
            of the evening breeze, and the waters that were above the dome. And
            it was so. To the woman he said, I will greatly increase your pangs
            in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth for you; and you
            shall eat bread until you return to the ground, and breathed into
            his nostrils the breath of life, I have given you every plant
            yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth. Out of the
            ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the wild
            animals of the field was yet in the earth were finished, and all
            their multitude.

        For the error checking, I added a try and catch error check. I did this because I feel it's the most
        intuitive way to error check for inputs in a form. What it does is it checks to see if the field
        is empty or not a number, and if any of those is true, then it throws an error. This error is then
        caught in the catch portion, where it then shows a browser alert using that specific error from the
        try portion.
